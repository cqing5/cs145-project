# cs145-project
For my final project for CS 145 (Data Management and Data Systems), a class on the use, design, and implementation of database and data-intensive systems, my partner and I harnessed and analyzed public datasets to investigate the relationship between urban greenery (e.g., amount of trees, type of trees) and property values in New York City. Motivated by research showing that the majority of low-income neighborhoods have less tree cover than high-income neighborhoods, we aimed to delve deeper into the potential relationship (and its nuances) between urban greenery and property values.
